Heya Tom, it's Bob from the office down the hall. It's good to see you buddy, how've you been? Things have been OK for me except that I'm a zombie now. I really wish you'd let us in. I think I speak for all of us when I say I understand. Why you folks might hesitate to submit to our demand. But here's an FYI: you're all gonna die screaming.

All we want to do is eat your brains. We're not unreasonable, I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes. All we want to do is eat your brains.We're at an impasse here, maybe we should compromise: If you open up the doors, we'll all come inside and eat your brains.
